problem-solving
====

Format of Folder Structure:

Make a folder with your name in the problem-solving folder and inside the named folder create a folder named lec. Inside the lec folder simply start at 0 for the first meeting and precede to increment the number with each additional number. Additional folders under your name are optional. An example could be a challange folder that you post solutions to and encourage others to try. A good place to find challenges is any of the numerous online judges such as http://acm.timus.ru/ or http://uva.onlinejudge.org/.

    0   1   2 etc...

Format of Solution Names:

All authors of a soultion should upload a copy of the soultion to their folder. All solutions should end in uppercase V followed by a number. For example, palindromesV0.cpp is a good name. The 0 solution should be the solution presented in class and alternate solutions solved in a different way should be given the next available number.

Try to Give Credit:

If you implement a cool algoritm or solution from somewhere link to it in the comments at the top so others who are interested can look at it. Also if you modify somone else's soltuion try to acknowledge who the orginal authors are.

Don't Mess With Other's Solutions:

While this may sound odd for a collaboration tool only alter soultions within your own folder. In the event you find a bug or think you find a bug add it to the issue tracker in github for them to ferret out.
