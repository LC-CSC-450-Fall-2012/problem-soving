Write a proglam to output the name for a golf score.
Gather input from (golf.in) and output to (golf.out).

The first line of the input file contains the number of entries.
On every line after that it contains two numbers 'p' and 's',
for par, and stroke. These are sperated by a space.

For each set of numbers write:

"hole-in-one","double-eagle","eagle","birdie","par",
"bogey","double-bogey","triple-bogey","four-over-par",
"five-over-par","six-over-par", or "seven-over-par".

To the output file, and iostream (if you wish).
