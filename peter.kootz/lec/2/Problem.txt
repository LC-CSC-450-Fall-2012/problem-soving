You are handed an extensive list of words, and asked which ones,
when converted into numbers on a phone ('a','b', or 'c' would be 2 ect.) if any of them  are palindromes. The input file you create 
(phone.txt)has the numbers of words in the file on the first line.
And on every consecutive line there is a new word to be checked.
Let your program output "YES" or "NO".
