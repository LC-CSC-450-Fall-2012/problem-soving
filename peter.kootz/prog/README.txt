Welcome to my Cprograms, these our all so open-source,
they don't have a liscence(sp).

Here is a list of my programs and their uses : 

HamiltonionBF.cpp/HamiltonionBT.cpp - These are brute force,
and backtracking solutions for finding a hamiltionion cycle
in graph embedded in the source code (M[SIZE][SIZE]).

N-QueensBT.cpp - Backtracking solution for the n-queens problem.

Prime_Test.c - Test to see if a number is prime, if it is not,
find it's factors.
